            My happiest day was our annual fest day.
            Every year my school hosts an annual fest.
            Several events like dance, music, painting and poetry competitions, take place.
            Last year my friends forced me to participate in the poetry competition.
            I write poetry since class one, but no one except some friends knew about it.
            I was shy to participate but still submitted on a poem.
            I didnâ€™t expect anything but surprisingly came first.
            I got my first gold medal. I also got a certificate and a gift hamper.
            My parents were delighted, and that was the happiest day of my life.</p>
