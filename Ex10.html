            There are days when we achieve everything that we wish for,<br>
             and then there are days when life becomes tough for us. <br>
             All these leave big marks on our memories. In my life of 10 years,<br>
              there have been a lot of happy days, but one of them was the happiest day of my life.<br>

            We are providing students of class 5 with two sample essays on ‘Happiest Day of My Life’ topic for reference.</p>
